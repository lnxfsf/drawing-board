# Drawing-board

From 1x1 to 64x64 squares in drawing box<br>
When on mouse hover draw on boxes.<br>
Support `single color` user chosen from color picker, or `rainbow` colors (random colors), `eraser` (which deletes one by one square by hovering over that square), and `clear` which clears whole drawing box.<br>
And there is `slider`, which changes size of squares in drawing box from 1x1 to 64x64.<br>
